# BootstrapProject
This project was made for academic purposes. The objective was to do a responsive website with 2 breakpoints/different devices.

Breakpoints:
- Mobile --> 748px 
- Computer --> 1920px

The project was made in Development &amp; UI Course at Flag, Lisbon.
I hope this can help more people in the same path as me.
